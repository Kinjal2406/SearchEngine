How Nasa is tracking asteroids with machine learning - Google About Our products Our commitments Our stories / A Google Short How one woman is using machine learning to help NASA track asteroids A Search On story about TensorFlow Earth is surrounded by thousands of asteroids and comets, classified as Near Earth Objects (NEOs). When NASA issued a challenge to use machine learning to help them track NEOs, Gema Parreño got to work. Using TensorFlow, Google’s open-source machine learning platform, Gema created a program called Deep Asteroid. Deep Asteroid helps scientists with asteroid tracking and classification.
